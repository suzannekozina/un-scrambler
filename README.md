# Un-scramlbler

## Quick Description

A simple Ruby project to provide beginning Rubyists with modifying and running Ruby code.

## Why I made this
As I was beginning to learn Ruby I noticed that there were few simple projects I could download, modify, and run locally on my computer. I decided to make one. This was also a way for me to stay fresh on skills that I learned very early on in the Udacity Ruby Programming Nanodegree.

## Windows anyone?
If you are on Windows and don't yet have a Ruby dev environment setup but WOULD like to experiment with running Ruby code locally on your windows computer, I highly recommend:
* [Ruby Installer for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
* [Atom editor for Windows](https://atom.io/)
* [Atom script package](https://atom.io/packages/script)
