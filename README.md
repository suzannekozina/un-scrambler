# Un-scrambler

## Quick Description
*For beginning Rubyists who'd like more practice with Ruby Strings* 
If you'd like to get a better feel of Ruby's public String methods you can fork this repo, download it onto your own dev setup and play around with the code. 

## Why I made this
 I made this repo with those who are new to programming in mind and those would like practice modifying and running Ruby code locally on their own computer (or virtual machine, cloud dev environment, IDE, text editor, etc.) As I was beginning to learn Ruby I noticed that there were few simple projects I could download, modify, and run locally on my computer. For that reason, I decided to make a couple simple and straight-forward Ruby projects. These projects are also a way for me to stay fresh on skills that I learned very early on in the [Udacity Ruby Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ruby-programming-nanodegree--nd010).

## Windows anyone?
If you are on Windows and don't yet have a Ruby dev environment setup but WOULD like to experiment with running Ruby code locally on your windows computer, I highly recommend:
* [Ruby Installer for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
* [Atom editor for Windows](https://atom.io/)
* [Atom script package](https://atom.io/packages/script)
